___

## 📘 Instructions

___

## ✏️ Development

1. Use the following list of materials for the elaboration of the activity. 

2. Based on the images shown in Figure 1, assemble an electronic circuit, in order to obtain a system capable of fulfilling the following instructions to obtain a system capable of complying with the following instructions:
    - By means of the application "Serial Bluetooth terminal" that can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or any other you consider, you will have to control the start and shutdown of a DC motor, i.e. there will be two requests, one of which will represent the "START" and the other option "STOP".
    - The motor must be able to rotate clockwise for 5 seconds, at the end of this time it must brake for 1 second and reverse its rotation for another 5 seconds. time it must brake for 1 second and will reverse its rotation for another 5 seconds.

3. Place here the image of the assembled circuit.
