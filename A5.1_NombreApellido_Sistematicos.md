## 🏆 A.5.1 Learning activity

Object color sensing and actuation system and visual interface
___

## 📘 Instructions

___

## ✏️ Development

1. Use the following list of materials for the elaboration of the activity

2. Based on the images shown in Figure 1, make a system capable of fulfilling the following conditions:
    
    - The first phase of the activity will consist of, by placing an object in front of the RGB sensor, it will identify what color it is (it is recommended to use Red, Green, and Blue objects for better accuracy), which will show in a visual interface what color was detected.
    - The second phase will consist of adding an actuator and a color identifier supported by a color band as shown in image 1; when the color of the object is known, the actuator should point to the color being detected.


3. Place here the image of the assembled circuit.

4. Place in this place the program created within the Arduino environment.

## Code
```c++

Arduino

```

5. Place here evidences that you consider important during the development of the activity.

## Evidences



6. For the demonstration of the activity more than one object should be used in order to cover at least three colors.
