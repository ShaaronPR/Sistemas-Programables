**Objective**

Realize a light (lux) measuring sensor by means of an electronic circuit, using a simulator, and a **LDR (Light dependent Resistor)**.

### :blue_book: Instructions
___

- It is suggested to use one of the following simulators for the development of this activity: [Autodesk Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [Virtual BreadBoard](https://www.virtualbreadboard.com/), [Easy EDA](https://easyeda.com/) so it will be necessary to familiarize yourself beforehand, and even to install or register within the platform.
- Any activity or challenge should be done using the **MarkDown style with extension .md** and the VSCode development environment, debiendo ser elaborado como un documento **single page**, that is, if the document has images, links or any external document, it must be accessed from tags and links, and it must be named with the nomenclature **A1.2_TituloActividad_NombreAlumno.pdf.**
- It is required that the .MD contains a link tag to the repository of your document in github, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the end of the challenge it must be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** file to be uploaded to classroom in its corresponding section, serving as evidence of your delivery, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the qualification of your activity.
- Considering that the .PDF file, which was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
- Your repository must also have a **readme.md** file in its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor's data, teacher's data, and so on, and even logo or images, you must have a contents section or index, which are actually **links to your .md documents**, avoid using text to indicate internal or external links.
- We propose a structure as shown below, but you can use any other structure to help you organize your repository.

2. Considering that the LDR element is a photoresistive sensor in other words, its resistance varies according to the amount of light that strikes it,, **What do you see in the graph below?**

3. Assemble the circuit shown using the simulator you have considered, placing the photoresistor in the LDR position and resistor according to the schematic image.

4. Place the finally obtained image of the assembled circuit inside your simulator.

5. To test the **resistance** of the photoresistor with the ohmmeter under the following conditions: no light or darkness, ambient light, intensive light.

6. Calculate the **theoretical Vout voltage value** for each of the above conditions as well as the measured Vout voltage value and record in the corresponding table.

7. Calculate the **accuracy value** of voltage between theoretical and measured for each condition and record in the corresponding table.

| Condition        | Impedance in photoresistance | Theoretical Vout voltage   | Measured voltage Vout  | % V.Measured/ V.Theoretical  |
|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Absence of light | | | | | 
| Ambient light	   | | | | |
| Intense light    | | | | |

8. **Graph** through the values recorded in the table above so that the behavior of the LDR component curve can be observed and **insert graph**.

9. Insert images of **evidence** such as meetings of team members held for the development of the activity.

10. Include individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.
