Make a light (lux) measuring sensor by means of an electronic circuit, using a simulator, and a **LDR (Light dependent Resistor)**.

### :blue_book: Instructions
___

- It is suggested to use one of the following simulators for the development of this activity: [Autodesk Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [Virtual BreadBoard](https://www.virtualbreadboard.com/), [Easy EDA](https://easyeda.com/) so it will be necessary to familiarize yourself beforehand, and even to install or register within the platform.
- Any activity or challenge should be done using the **MarkDown style with extension .md** and the VSCode development environment, it must be elaborated as a document  **single page**, that is, if the document has images, links or any external document, it must be accessed from tags and links, and it must be named with the nomenclature **A1.2_TituloActividad_NombreAlumno.pdf.**
- It is required that the .MD contains a link tag to the repository of your document in github, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the end of the challenge it must be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file export to a **.pdf** file so it is be uploaded to classroom in its corresponding section, serving as evidence of your delivery, since it is the **official** platform here you will receive the grade of your activity.
- Considering that the .PDF file  was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
- Your repository must also have a **readme.md** file in its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor's data, teacher's data, and so on, and even logo or images, you must have a contents section or index, which are actually **links to your .md documents**, avoid using text to indicate internal or external links.
- We propose a structure as shown below, but you can use any other structure to help you organize your repository.

1. Use the following list of materials for the elaboration of the activity and add your bibliographic link in the Source of reference column.

| **Quantity**  | **Description**                   | **Source of reference**                                                                                            |

| 1		          | Resistance 1k                     | [RESISTENCIA 1K OHMS 1/4W](https://tostatronic.com/store/es/componentes-pasivos/887-resistencia-1k-ohms-14w.html)  |

2. Considering that the LDR element is a photoresistive sensor in other words, its resistance varies according to the amount of light that strikes it, **What do you see in the graph below?**

</p>

  - In the first images we can observe how a real LDR looks like and also how it's represented in electronic diagrams. You can also see a lamp giving light to a photoresistance sensor and a little graph of how the resistance behaves according to the light. Then there's a more detailed graph with aproximated quantitys for Dark night time and Bright sunlight you can also see the unit of measurement for the resistance and light (ohms and lux). You can conclude that at more light the less resistance the LDR holds. 

3. Assemble the circuit shown using the simulator you have considered, placing the photoresistor in the LDR position and resistor according to the schematic image.

    </p>
    
4. Place the final obtained image of the assembled circuit inside your simulator.

    </p>
    
5. Test the **resistance** of the photoresistor with the ohmmeter under the following conditions: no light or darkness, ambient light, intensive light.

    </p>

6. Calculate the theoretical Vout voltage value for each of the conditions.

7. Measure the measured Vout voltage value for each of the conditions.

8. Calculate the voltage accuracy value between theoretical and measured for each condition, consider including in this section the explaining of how the theoretical calculations were obtained.

9. Measure the **resistance** of the photoresistor with the ohmmeter under the following conditions: no light or darkness, ambient light, intensive light and record in the corresponding table.

10. Calculate the **theoretical Vout voltage value** for each of the above conditions as well as the measured Vout voltage value and record in the corresponding table.

11. Calculate the **voltage accuracy value** between theoretical and measured for each condition and record in the corresponding table.

| Condition        | Impedance in photoresistance | Theoretical Vout voltage   | Measured voltage Vout  | % V.Measured/ V.Theoretical  |
|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Absence of light | 180 kΩ | 1000 / (1000 + 180000) * 5V = 0.02762V | 27.7mV | 99.78% | 
| Ambient light	   | 912 Ω | 1000 / (1000 + 912) * 5V = 2.615V | 2.61V | 99.8% |
| Intense light    | 506 Ω | 1000 / (1000 + 506) * 5V = 3.32V  | 3.32V | 100% |

Absence of light = (1000 * 5V) / (180000 + 1000) = 0.0277V
Ambient light = (1000 * 5V) / (912 + 1000) = 2.615V
Intense light = (1000 * 5V) / (506 + 1000) = 3.32V

12. Make a graph using the values recorded in the table above, where the "X" axis is the measured Vout Voltage and the "Y" axis represents the impedance at the LDR photoresistor, and **insert the graph**.

13. Insert images of **evidence** such as meetings of team members held for the development of the activity.

14. Include individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.
