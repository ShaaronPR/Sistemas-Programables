___

## üìò Instructions

- It is suggested to use one of the following simulators for the development of this activity: [Autodesk Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [Virtual BreadBoard](https://www.virtualbreadboard.com/), [Easy EDA](https://easyeda.com/), for which it will be necessary to familiarize yourself before, and even install or register in the platform.

- Every activity or challenge must be done using the **MarkDown style with .md extension** and the VSCode development environment, and must be elaborated as a **single page** document, that is to say, if the document has images, links or any external document it must be accessed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A2.2_TituloActividad_NombreAlumno.pdf**.

- It is required that the .md contains a link tag to the repository of your document in GITHUB, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the end of the challenge it must be uploaded to github.

- From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** file that should be uploaded to classroom in its corresponding section, serving as evidence of its delivery, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the grade of your activity.

- Considering that the .PDF file, which was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.

- Your repository, besides having a **readme**.md file within its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor data, and even logo or images, must have a contents section or index, which are actually **links to your .md documents**, avoid using text to indicate internal or external links.

- The proposed structure is as shown below, but you can use any other structure to help you organize your repository.

  1. Use the electronic circuit in the image below and assemble stage 1 inside the simulator.
  
  <p align="center">
    <img alt="C2.x_NE555" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaaronPR/Sistemas-Programables/main/imagenes/C2.x_NE555.PNG" width=1000 height=500>
</p>
  

2. As you can see in the previous circuit there is an area identified as "Time Network" and another "Decoupling Filter", **explain the purpose of both terminologies**.

> - **Time network:** This terminology refers to the time constant set by the following equation Ct= 1.1 * R1 * C1.  This section will tells us the amount of time that the output voltage remains high.

> - **Decoupling filter:** The decoupling filter as it's name references filters signals. It is done by an electrolytic condenser and it's used to conduct the alternating corrent around a group of components. It takes care of noise by helping to create a cleaner direct current (DC) signal. By bringing AC signals to ground, all noise from a DC signal is eliminated.

3. Continuing with the previous image, note the equation Ct= 1.1 * R1 * C1, which is used to **set the output pulse** on time. Based on that equation above calculate the values of **R1** and **C1** if you want to keep the output pulse on, given the 3 conditions required in the attached table.

**Number** | **Condition**  | **Value of R1** | **Value of C1** |
-----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
 1         | 3 seconds      | 5.80 kŒ©         | 47 uF           |
 2         | 5 seconds      | 9.67 kŒ©         | 47 uF           |
 3         | 8 seconds      | 15.47 kŒ©        | 47 uF           |

>
> **Formula: T = 1.1 * R1 * C1**
> 
>   T = signal time (s)
>   
>   R = resistance value (Œ©)
>   
>   C = capacitor value (F - Faraday).
 
> 
> First, we clear the formula (T = 1.1 * R1 * C1) for R1 and C1 as follows:
> 
> R1 * C1 = T / 1.1
> 
> **R1 = T / (C1 * 1.1)**
  
> 
> To find the value of the resistance we give a fixed value to the capacitor, which is indicated in the material table. This being 47uf and R1 will be cleared from the formula.
> 
> ***Number 1***
> 
>   R1 = 3s / (0.00047uF * 1.1)
>   
>   *R1 = 5.802 kŒ©*
>   
>   **Real or commercial value: 5.6 kŒ©**
   
>   
> ***Number 2***
> 
>   R1 = 5s / (0.00047uF * 1.1)
>   
>   *R1 = 9.671 kŒ©*
>   
>   **Real or commercial value: 10 kŒ©**
  
>   
> ***Number 3***
> 
>   R1 = 8s / (0.00047uF * 1.1)
>   
>   *R1 = 15.473 kŒ©*
>   
>   **Real or commercial value: 15 kŒ©**
>   

4. Once the above table is completed, start the simulation for any of the three conditions and observe the behavior of the LED; **explain your observation**.

> 
> When you press the button for an amount of time you can see in the oscilloscope how it goes to a high state for the period of time it's pushed, when you stop pressing it goes back to low.Since the condenser is connected to the 8 terminal of the timer the signal behavior is more constant.
> 

5. Assemble stage 2 and integrate the output pulse terminal to the transistor base input of this second stage. 

<p align="center">

6. Upon completion of the previous step, choose one of the 3 conditions recorded in the table above and observe the behavior of the DC motor; **explain your observation**.
> 
> In the oscilloscope you can see that the signal behaves the same way as before but now with the addition of the DC motor and the surrounding elements you can observe that when you press the button not only does the signal goes high but also the motor starts moving forward, once you stop pressing it the DC motor also stops any activity. Thanks to the circuit when you press the button you can now control the motor.
> 

7. Once the on-time of the output pulse of stage 1 is complete, **what happens to the DC motor? Explain the reason for this behavior?**

>
> Once the time of the LM555 expires, the motor stops receiving current as well as the other components and then it stops rotating since when the current is cut it can no longer continue operating

## Conclusions for each of the team members.

ü•û **Shaaron Porras Rangel:** 

In practice we could see how the circuit was affected by the LM555 integrated circuit, which produces timing pulses per microsecond which affects the entire operation of the voltage pass, we could also observe the operation of the DC motor, which personally I had not handled before and after analyzing the circuit and doing the feedback I could understand how it works and how to connect it properly.

üêï **Jesus Xavier Lopez Galaz:** 

In this practice we have realized the capacity of this amplifier together with the functions that the capacitors have so that the motor can work, which is a small one and can be applied in small toys, the main one is the 555 timer and it allows us that by pressing the button do an action in a certain time. This could be seen even on a large scale in the industry with larger electric motors.

üßÄ **Karla Dinora Urrea Soto:**

This practice makes use of quite a few electronic components, this made me see how each of them can take part in the same circuit for a specific purpose. I found it interesting to have a DC motor because I could see how these exercises can take part in the real world. The practice was also useful for me to know how the timer works and how each of it's terminals need to be used.

üê∂ **Carlos Fernando Leal Oliva:**

In this activity we saw the behavior of a timer and how it affects the circuit, in this case we did it so that it would move a motor and turn on a led and I found it very interesting how it worked and showed that the voltage of another can be handled shape
