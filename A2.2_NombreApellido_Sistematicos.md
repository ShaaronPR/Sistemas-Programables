## üèÜ A.2.1 Learning activity

Perform a start and ignition control system for an electric actuator through a circuit electronic, using a simulator, a **NE55s Timer** and a **DC Motor**.

___

## üìò Instructions

- It is suggested to use one of the following simulators for the development of this activity: [Autodesk Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [Virtual BreadBoard](https://www.virtualbreadboard.com/), [Easy EDA](https://easyeda.com/), for which it will be necessary to familiarize yourself before, and even install or register in the platform.

- Every activity or challenge must be done using the **MarkDown style with .md extension** and the VSCode development environment, and must be elaborated as a **single page** document, that is to say, if the document has images, links or any external document it must be accessed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A2.2_TituloActividad_NombreAlumno.pdf**.

- It is required that the .md contains a link tag to the repository of your document in GITHUB, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the end of the challenge it must be uploaded to github.

- From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** file that should be uploaded to classroom in its corresponding section, serving as evidence of its delivery, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the grade of your activity.

- Considering that the .PDF file, which was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.

- Your repository, besides having a **readme**.md file within its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor data, and even logo or images, must have a contents section or index, which are actually **links to your .md documents**, avoid using text to indicate internal or external links.

- The proposed structure is as shown below, but you can use any other structure to help you organize your repository.

  1. Use the electronic circuit in the image below and assemble stage 1 inside the simulator.
  
  <p align="center">
    <img alt="C2.x_NE555" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaaronPR/Sistemas-Programables/main/imagenes/C2.x_NE555.PNG" width=1000 height=500>
</p>
  

2. As you can see in the previous circuit there is an area identified as "Time Network" and another "Decoupling Filter", **explain the purpose of both terminologies**.

>  Time network
>  Decoupling filter: The decoupling filter as it's name references filters signals. It is done by an electrolytic condenser and it's used to conduct the alternating corrent around a group of components. It takes care of noise by helping to create a cleaner direct current (DC) signal. By bringing AC signals to ground, all noise from a DC signal is eliminated.

3. Continuing with the previous image, note the equation Ct= 1.1 * R1 * C1, which is used to **set the output pulse** on time. Based on that equation above calculate the values of **R1** and **C1** if you want to keep the output pulse on, given the 3 conditions required in the attached table.

**Number** | **Condition**  | **Value of R1** | **Value of C1** |
-----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
 1         | 3 seconds      | 5.80 kŒ©         | 47 uF            |
 2         | 5 seconds      | 9.67 kŒ©         | 47 uF            |
 3         | 8 seconds      | 15.47 kŒ©        | 47 uF            |

>
> **Formula: T = 1.1 * R1 * C1**
> 
>   T = signal time (s)
>   
>   R = resistance value (Œ©)
>   
>   C = capacitor value (F - Faraday).
 
> 
> First, we clear the formula (T = 1.1 * R1 * C1) for R1 and C1 as follows:
> 
> R1 * C1 = T / 1.1
> 
> **R1 = T / (C1 * 1.1)**
  
> 
> To find the value of the resistance we give a fixed value to the capacitor, which is indicated in the material table. This being 47uf and R1 will be cleared from the formula.
> 
> ***Number 1***
> 
>   R1 = 3s / (0.00047uF * 1.1)
>   
>   *R1 = 5.802 kŒ©*
>   
>   **Real or commercial value: 5.6 kŒ©**
   
>   
> ***Number 2***
> 
>   R1 = 5s / (0.00047uF * 1.1)
>   
>   *R1 = 9.671 kŒ©*
>   
>   **Real or commercial value: 10 kŒ©**
  
>   
> ***Number 3***
> 
>   R1 = 8s / (0.00047uF * 1.1)
>   
>   *R1 = 15.473 kŒ©*
>   
>   **Real or commercial value: 15 kŒ©**
>   

4. Once the above table is completed, start the simulation for any of the three conditions and observe the behavior of the LED; **explain your observation**.
