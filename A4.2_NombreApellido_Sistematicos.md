NodeMCU ESP32 light actuation and lighting sensor circuit via Wi-Fi
___

## 📘 Instructions

___

## ✏️ Development

1. Use the following list of materials for the elaboration of the activity

2. Based on the image shown in Figure 1, assemble an electronic circuit and add an LED to one of the terminals of the device, in such a way that you can obtain a system capable of fulfilling the following instructions:

    - The NodeMCU shall be used as a standalone Web server, which shall provide a visual interface, which will display an image representing an "ON and OFF" behavior depending on the ambient lighting condition.
    - The illumination sensor should be measuring the amount of light in the environment.
    - When the LDR sensor detects the absence of light, it should show an "ON" status on the Web interface, otherwise it should show an "OFF" status.
    - To the circuit of figure 1 a relay must be added in series with a light bulb, which will be activated in the opposite condition to the "ON" and "OFF" state, i.e. once the sensor detects little or no illumination it will activate the relay and therefore turn on the light bulb, and otherwise it will turn it off.

3. Place here the image of the assembled circuit.

4. Place in this place the program created within the Arduino environment.

## Code
